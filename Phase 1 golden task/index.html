            <h2><span style="color: rgb(24, 100, 241)">Tiruchendur Murugan Temple</span></h2>
            <p>The <span style="color: rgb(233, 6, 2)">Arulmigu Subramanya Swami Temple</span> in Tiruchendur is an ancient Hindu temple dedicated to Murugan. It is the <span style="color: rgb(233, 6, 2)">second among six abodes of Murugan</span> situated in Tamil Nadu, India. The temple was occupied by the Dutch East India Company from 1646 to 1648 during their war with the Portuguese. The local people tried to free their temple, with no success. The Dutch finally vacated the temple on orders from the Naik ruler, but removed a sculpture depicting the deities. During their sea voyage, they encountered a strong storm and realized their mistake. They dropped the sculpture in the sea, which led to the storm stopping immediately. According to legend, Murugan appeared in a dream to Vadamaliyappa Pillai, an ardent devotee, and revealed the place where the idol was abandoned. Pillai retrieved the idol in 1653. The story is depicted in paintings inside the temple.</p>

            <h2><span style="color: rgb(24, 100, 241)">Dindigul Fort</span></h2>
            <p><span style="color: rgb(233, 6, 2);">The Dindigul Fort or Dindigul Malai Kottai and Abirami amman Kalaheswarar Temple</span> was built in 16th-century by Madurai Nayakar Dynasty situated in the town of Dindigul in the state of Tamil Nadu in India. The fort was built by the <span style="color: rgb(233, 6, 2);">Madurai</span> Nayakar king <span style="color: rgb(233, 6, 2);">Muthu Krishnappa Nayakar</span> in <span style="color: rgb(233, 6, 2);">1605</span>.

In 1799 it went to the control of the British East India Company during the Polygar Wars. There is an abandoned temple on its peak apart from few cannons sealed with balls inside.These canons are very heavy. In modern times, the fort is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and is open to tourists.The history of Dindigul is centered on the fort over the small rock hill and fort. Dindigul region was the border of the three prominent kingdoms of South India, the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. During the first century A.D., the Chola king Karikal Cholan captured the Pandya kingdom and Dindigul came under the Chola rule. During the sixth century, the Pallavas took over most provinces of Southern India and Dindigul was under the rule of Pallavas until Cholas regained the state in the 9th century and the Pandyas regained control by the 13th century.In the 14th century, half of Tamil Nadu kingdoms were under the short-reigned Delhi Sultanates with Madurai Sultanate ruling this region between 1335–1378. By end of 1378, the Muslim rulers were defeated by the Vijayanagara army who later established their rule.</p>
